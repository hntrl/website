# Content List

I've seen a lot of lists where people list the books they read (or a letterboxd account if you're into that).

I grew up in a time where books were the last thing you drew inspiration from. I've shaped who I am as a person around the mixed media of the internet (and a few books here and there).

This isn't by any means "a favorite list," but it's a list of pieces of media that have made me better after I engaged with them.
